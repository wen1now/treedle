            These are the bare minimum instructions for what to do to play.
            For an explanation of what's actually going on,
            click <a href="technical.html">here</a>.

        <p>
            On the right you will be shown a set of past Wordle guess.
            Initially, there will be nothing there, corresponding to a
            completely new game of Wordle. Your job is to guess a new word.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, the game will randomly generate a new set of guesses and 
            make you try again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your aim is to choose the optimal word at each step, where the
            optimal guess is the word that minimises the average number of 
            guesses you would need to finish the game.
