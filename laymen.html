            This is a laymen's explanation of Treedle. For a
            computer sciencey/mathematical explanation,

            Suppose you had to use the exact same strategy every time you played
            Wordle. So, for example, your first guess always has to be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treedle takes this to the extreme, by giving you every possible 
            position you might find yourself in, and asking what you would do.
            In fact, it makes you map out your <i>entire game</i> of Wordle.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, when the game ends, you will have created a set of 
            instructions for playing a game of Wordle, of the form,
        </p>
        <p>
            "if you have
            made these guesses and see so-and-so colors, then your next
            guess should be: [insert word]."
        </p>
        <p>
            Your score, then, is the average number of guesses your strategy
            requires, multiplied by the total number of words in Wordle.
