            This is a technical explanation of Treedle. For a layman's explanation,

        <p>
            Imagine playing Wordle following a deterministic strategy. This
            strategy can be represented by a decision tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Treedle helps you create this decision tree. It initialises a tree 
            with an <i>open</i> empty root node.
            At each step, it chooses a random open node of the
            tree, and asks you what you would play if that was the state of the 
            Wordle game.
        </p>
        <p>
            After your input, it generates all possible game states that
            could follow from your guess, adds them as open
            child nodes, and closes the current node.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game ends when all nodes are closed; in other words, when 
            every possible game of Wordle has been played.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your score is the total number of guesses you would use if you
            were to use this decision tree to play every possible game.
            This works out to be the average number of guesses times
            the number of words.
